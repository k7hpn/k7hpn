# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Harald Nagel](https://hpn.is/) (friends call me H.P.). I've been doing professional software development for over 25 years. Lately my work has been with C# (mostly ASP.NET), but in the past I've done development in tons of different environments.

## Minuti&aelig;

- I currently spend a lot of time on [MCLD/greatreadingadventure](https://github.com/MCLD/greatreadingadventure/) and [MCLD/ocuda](https://github.com/MCLD/ocuda/).
- My username (K7HPN) is my amateur radio callsign, I've been licensed since 1993.
- I also enjoy archery and photography.
